Percussion CM1 .Net API Client

This project provides a C# Wrapper Library around the CM1 REST API's for use in .NET applications
with the intent of making the API more immediately accessible to .NET developers. 

To use this library in your project simply build the source and reference the assembly in your .NET project. 

NOTE:  This is a work in progress and is still incomplete.  Check the issue list for what needs completed.  
Any contributions appreciated, I maintain this project in my spare time.
